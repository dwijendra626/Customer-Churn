## Project Description
----------------------

In order to learn about bank's customers we will make use of one of the Deep Learning techniques,i.e.,  ***Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)***. Moreover, we will use popular Python libraries such as ***Tensorflow***, ***Keras*** and Machine Learning techniques such as Adam Optimizer to train the ANN model and predict the churn rates.
